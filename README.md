## Background & Challenge
One of the most favored consumables the world over is beer, and that is no different in the United States. According to [usatoday.com](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/09/14/how-much-beer-did-the-average-person-drink-in-every-state/40109241/), the average American consumes 26.2 gallons of beer per year. 

Our fictitious brewing company “Big yEAST” has been a staple on the 
eastern seaboard for several decades. A recent evaluation of regional 
market trends has shown a decline in total consumption of beer, especially with the key demographic of (25-34-year-old individuals). Bill Barley, the President & CEO of Big yEAST, has commissioned a high-level exploratory market review of several locations in the western United States in the hope that Big yEAST can establish a position in either a developed or emerging market with the presence of a local brewery.
